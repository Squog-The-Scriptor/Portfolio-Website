                Hello Web-Traveller! Thanks for visiting my portfolio website! 
                I'm Kevin, I am a Kinesiologist who works at a Physiotherapy clinic. I help people become pain free and get to back to their normal lives. 
                I currently am learning how to self-code and are looking to transition into Front-End Engineering then into Software Engineering later on!
                </p>
                <p>
                I enjoy gaming (OSRS, SC2, League, and other some games), card and board games (yugioh and MTG). Cooking at a high level and trying interesting new foods!
                Physical fitness and strength training are a core essentials in my life also! I also enjoy watching movies and history! 
                </p>

                <p>
                I am excited to continue my journey towards becoming a Front-End Engineer and eventually a Software Engineer!
                </p>
